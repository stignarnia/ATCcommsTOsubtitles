[metaTypes.Timestamp]
; Every combination of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds is supported for *input parsing*.
; Important: ASS/SSA event timestamps are centiseconds (H:MM:SS.cc), not milliseconds. If an ASS file
; uses ".mmm", VLC/libass can treat that suffix as centiseconds and display events overlapping.
; This project therefore writes centisecond-precision timestamps to the output ASS.

C = In the simulation I clear Lufthansa and TAP43RY to FL80 only now, this is because, since I told them to descend when ready, we assume they decided this is their calculated top of descent. This was the only way to make the simulation understand this. The simulation will now make them descend at 1600 fpm but in reality they would use a managed descent and be at FL80 at MAZUK
T = 17:07
C = In the simulation you see TAP43RY reaching INBOM and continuing on heading 219. This is wrong. In reality, we cleared them for the INBOM arrival so they would turn towards the next waypoint after INBOM which is PT808
